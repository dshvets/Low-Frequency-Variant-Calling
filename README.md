## Low-Frequency-Variant-Calling
All code is part of a pipeline created for performing low frequency variant calling on whole-exome sequencing data. 

###Project Description
This work was my summer (2015) research project investing [Clonal Hematopoiesis](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1409405) in the NIH [ClinSeq](http://www.genome.gov/ClinSeq/) cohort. 

Clonal Hematopoiesis is the clonal expansion of hematopoietic stem cells, which are the stem cells that give rise to all other cells within the blood, and in turn play an important role in hematologic malignancies. The prevalence of many hematologic malignancies is known to increase with age, and many cancers are known to arise from the gradual accumulation of mutations over time. This then raises the question, whether there is a pre-malignant state that can be found through DNA sequencing that also increases in prevalence with age, and that can be used to screen patients as high risk for certain hematologic diseases and disorders.
